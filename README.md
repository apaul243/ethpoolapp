## SMART CONTRACT DESIGN (ethPool.sol)

Design can be little tricky because of : \
**Problems:** 
1. How do we distribute rewards ? If we have many users (let's say 10,000), will we update the "Rewards Balance" of all 10k users every time the team adds rewards?
   Such operation can be very expensive storage and operation wise. My design includes calculation of rewards at the time of method call.
2. Different users have different entry point and they are not be eligible for rewards added before their entry into the pool (see challenge example) 

**Solutions:** \
Liquiduty protocols like Uniswap/Compound mint/burn 'aTokens' to solve these issues. I have come up with an innovative algorithim to overcome the above two challenges. 

 *uint256 RewardPerEth = 0 \
  mapping(address=>uint) providers // maintains total deposits of each users \
  mapping(address=>uint) rewards  // maintains RewardPerEth when the user entered the pool \
  RewardPerEth += (weeklyRewardAdded/totalPoolDeposits)* 

 Let us understand above with an example: 
  
**Let's say pool has 500 eth as deposits(userA -->300 eth, userB --> 200 eth) and team adds 50 eth as rewards. Now RewardPerEth = 50/500 = 0.1 reward per eth 
  of deposit.**
   
   *userA{providers[address]:300, rewards[address]: 0} // rewards mapping basically calculates the RewardPerEth when the user entered the pool \
   userB{providers[address]:200, rewards[address]: 0} \
   RewardPerEth = 0.1 ( after team adds rewards)*
   
**User C enters and adds 250 eth more to the pool. Team adds 150 more eth as rewards. Now RewardPerEth = 150/750 = 0.2 reward per eth**   
   
   *userC{providers[address]:250, rewards[address]: 0.1} // For userC, rewards[address] has been set to RewardPerEth when he entered the pool. \
   RewardPerEth = 0.3*
 
**How much rewards will userA , userB and userC get if they want to withdraw at end of week2 ?** \
    userA : (300)*(0.3 - 0.0) = 90 eth // formula = balance*(RewardPerEth at Pool Entry - RewardPerEth current) \
    userB : (200)*(0.3 - 0.0) = 60 eth \
    userC : (250)*(0.3 - 0.1) = 50 eth // 90+60+50 = 200 eth

 Note: This contract has been designed considering Users withdraw their complete deposits at once. Program might have to be modified if they do partial    withdrawals. In that case we will have (address => mapping(uint=>uint)) providers; which will keep record of RewardPerEth at every deposit.

## SMART CONTRACT TESTS (ethPoolTests.js)

The above smart contract has been thoroughly tested using the chai/mocha framework using the examples given in the challenge statement. 

## SMART CONTRACT SCRIPTS (deploy.js, ropstenDataLoad and getContractData)

Four different accounts were created using Metamask wallet @Ropsten test network and funds were loaded using test faucet. Infura node was setup to connect to Ropsten net. Config is available in hardhat.config. 

**deploy.js** \
Deploys the contract to Ropsten testnet and logs the address of the deployed contract

**ropstenDataLoad** \
This script has been used for the following: (1) Perform depositEth() from users (2) perform depositRewards() from team (3) Provide methods to query contract state using ethers.provider

**getContractData** \
This script provides methods to : readUserBalance, readContractBalance, readTotalDeposits and readTotalRewards


## GraphQL Design
High level graphQL design would look like something this:

*type ethPool @entity {
  id: ID!
  address: Bytes!   // Contract Address
  totalDeposits: BigInt! # uint256  // Total deposits in the pool at a given time
  totalRewards: BigInt! # uint256   // Total Rewards in the pool at a given time
  Users: User
}
type User @entity {
  id: ID!
  address: Bytes!
  totalEthProvided: BigInt! # uint256
  deposits : Deposit
  withdrawals : Withdrawal
}
type Deposit @entity {
  id: ID!
  timestamp: Int!
  amount: BigInt! # uint256
}
type Withdrawal @entity {
  id: ID!
  timestamp: Int!
  amount: BigInt! # uint256
}*
